## üéØ Enhanced Counterparty Risk Scoring - Detailed Breakdown

The new system provides **exactly what you requested** - detailed explanations of where and why points are deducted:

### Scoring Methodology:
```
Base Score: 100 points

Weighted Components:
- Document Analysis (40% weight)
- Financial Analysis (35% weight)  
- Legal Structure (25% weight)
- Document Sentiment (10% adjustment)
```

### Sample Deduction Breakdown:
```json
{
  "score": 65,
  "deductions": [
    {
      "category": "Financial Disclosure",
      "pointsDeducted": 15,
      "reason": "Limited financial information provided",
      "source": "Document Analysis",
      "weight": 0.4
    },
    {
      "category": "Counterparty Identity", 
      "pointsDeducted": 20,
      "reason": "Insufficient counterparty identification details",
      "source": "Document Analysis",
      "weight": 0.4
    },
    {
      "category": "Leverage Risk",
      "pointsDeducted": 12,
      "reason": "High debt-to-equity ratio: 1.2",
      "source": "Financial Analysis", 
      "weight": 0.35
    },
    {
      "category": "Contract Structure",
      "pointsDeducted": 8,
      "reason": "Incomplete contract structure elements",
      "source": "Legal Analysis",
      "weight": 0.25
    }
  ],
  "methodology": "Enhanced multi-source risk assessment",
  "confidence": 78
}
```

## üîß How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies:
```bash
cd api
npm install
```

### 2. Configure API Keys (Optional):
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env file with your API keys (optional - works without them)
COURT_LISTENER_API_KEY=your_key_here
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 3. Start the Server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
node server.js
```

### 4. Test the Integration:
```bash
node test_enhanced_analysis.js
```

## üéØ New API Endpoints

### Main Analysis Endpoint:
```
POST /api/enhanced-analysis/analyze
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "documentText": "Your legal document text...",
  "documentType": "contract",
  "companyName": "Counterparty Company Name",
  "industry": "technology"
}
```

**Response with Detailed Scoring:**
```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "enhancedCounterpartyRisk": {
      "score": 68,
      "riskLevel": "medium", 
      "deductions": [
        {
          "category": "Financial Disclosure",
          "pointsDeducted": 15,
          "reason": "Limited financial information provided",
          "source": "Document Analysis"
        }
      ],
      "factors": [...],
      "confidence": 78
    },
    "comprehensiveRecommendations": {
      "immediate": ["Request additional counterparty documentation"],
      "shortTerm": ["Review debt capacity and refinancing plans"],
      "monitoring": ["Regular review of counterparty financial condition"]
    },
    "executiveSummary": {
      "overallRisk": "medium",
      "score": 68,
      "primaryConcerns": ["Elevated financial risk indicators"],
      "nextSteps": ["Conduct detailed due diligence"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Other Endpoints:
- `GET /api/enhanced-analysis/health` - Service health check
- `POST /api/enhanced-analysis/translate` - Document translation
- `POST /api/enhanced-analysis/legal-precedents` - Legal precedent search
- `POST /api/enhanced-analysis/financial-risk` - Financial risk assessment

## üéâ Key Benefits

1. **Detailed Risk Explanations**: Every point deduction is explained with category, reason, and source
2. **Multi-source Analysis**: Combines document analysis, financial data, and legal patterns
3. **Free Implementation**: Uses only free/open-source APIs and libraries
4. **Comprehensive Output**: Provides recommendations, executive summary, and confidence metrics
5. **Fallback Systems**: Works even when external APIs are unavailable
6. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add more data sources and analysis types

## üîç How Risk Deductions Work

The system analyzes documents and assigns point deductions based on:

### Document Analysis (40% weight):
- **Financial Disclosure** (-15 points): Limited financial information
- **Counterparty Identity** (-20 points): Insufficient identification details  
- **Operational Risk** (-10 points): Key person dependencies
- **Compliance Risk** (-12 points): Missing regulatory frameworks

### Financial Analysis (35% weight):
- **Leverage Risk** (-15 points): High debt-to-equity ratios
- **Liquidity Risk** (-12 points): Poor current ratios
- **Profitability Risk** (-20 points): Negative margins
- **Earnings Quality** (-10 points): Missing estimates

### Legal Structure (25% weight):
- **Contract Structure** (variable): Missing essential elements
- **Risk Distribution** (-10 points): Unbalanced risk allocation
- **Enforcement Mechanisms** (-8 points): Weak dispute resolution

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Start the server** and test the new endpoints
2. **Integrate with your frontend** to display the detailed risk breakdowns
3. **Obtain API keys** for Court Listener and Alpha Vantage (optional but recommended)
4. **Customize risk factors** based on your specific legal analysis needs
5. **Add caching** for better performance with repeated analyses

## üìû Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
node test_enhanced_analysis.js
```

This will test all endpoints and show you exactly how the detailed risk scoring works!
