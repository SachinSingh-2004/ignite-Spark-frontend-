## Enhanced Counterparty Risk Scoring

The new counterparty risk scoring system provides detailed breakdowns of where and why points were deducted:

### Scoring Components (Weighted):
- **Document Analysis (40%)**: Legal terms, clauses, sentiment
- **Financial Analysis (35%)**: Company financial health, ratios, earnings
- **Legal Structure (25%)**: Contract completeness, risk distribution
- **Market Sentiment (10%)**: Document tone and language patterns

### Sample Risk Deduction Breakdown:
```json
{
  "score": 65,
  "deductions": [
    {
      "category": "Financial Disclosure",
      "pointsDeducted": 15,
      "reason": "Limited financial information provided",
      "source": "Document Analysis",
      "weight": 0.4
    },
    {
      "category": "Leverage Risk",
      "pointsDeducted": 12,
      "reason": "High debt-to-equity ratio: 1.2",
      "source": "Financial Analysis",
      "weight": 0.35
    },
    {
      "category": "Contract Structure",
      "pointsDeducted": 8,
      "reason": "Incomplete contract structure elements",
      "source": "Legal Analysis",
      "weight": 0.25
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Document Analysis:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/enhanced-analysis/analyze', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    documentText: "CONTRACT AGREEMENT between Party A and Party B...",
    documentType: "contract",
    companyName: "ACME Corp",
    industry: "technology"
  })
});
```

### Translation Only:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/enhanced-analysis/translate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: "This is a legal contract",
    targetLanguage: "hi", // Hindi
    sourceLanguage: "en"
  })
});
```

## Performance Considerations

- All analyses run in parallel for optimal performance
- Fallback mechanisms ensure service availability
- Caching can be implemented for repeated analyses
- Rate limiting protects against API quota exhaustion
- Timeout configurations prevent hanging requests

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Graceful API failures with fallback data
- Detailed error messages and codes
- Service availability indicators
- Confidence scoring based on data availability

## Installation

1. Install new dependencies:
```bash
cd api
npm install
```

2. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

3. Start the enhanced API:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The enhanced analysis endpoints will be available at `/api/enhanced-analysis/*`

## Future Enhancements

Potential future integrations:
- Additional legal databases (Justia, OpenJurist)
- More financial data providers  
- Advanced machine learning models
- Real-time market data integration
- Custom legal clause libraries
- Industry-specific analysis modules

This enhanced analysis system significantly improves the platform's capabilities while maintaining cost-effectiveness through the use of open source and free tier services.
